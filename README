Generate 1337 speak permutations of words from a wordlist.

Setup:

Edit the 'leetDict' dictionary in permuteWordlist.py to taste.
This dictionary maps characters to substitute to their possible substitutions.
It supports unicode substitutions if you're going to crazytown.

To run:

php permuteWordlist.php input_file.txt output_file.txt

See the examples directory for an example input file (bare_wordlist.example) and
output file (permuted_wordlist.example). Output can get pretty sizable.
